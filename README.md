Library Loan Record Tracking System
Develop a library loan record tracking system to track loan records in a library. Library patrons may borrow books, magazines, movies, compact discs, and audio tapes. Each copy of a library item must be managed. For example, a library may have five copies of the book “The Grapes of Wrath”. Your system must track borrowers, their addresses, and phone number. Each borrower is assigned a library card.
Each category of library item has a standard checkout period and number of renewals. For example, children’s books may be checked out for a month, while adult books may be checked out for only two weeks. Ordinary books can be renewed once; books with a pending request may not be renewed. Your system must record the actual return date and any fine that was paid. Your system must maintain any records of damage and loss and associated payments. Your system must also enable searches, such as
• Total fine owed by a patron.
• Fine revenue to the library for an interval of time.
• The copies of library items that are grossly overdue. “Grossly” is the number of days specified by the librarian.
